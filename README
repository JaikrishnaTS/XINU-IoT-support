  - The Python webserver and supporting files (in webapp directory)
  - The applications developed for demonstration and working of the project (in xinu_apps directory)
  - Project Report (in report.pdf)
  - DDL parser application for configuring Xinu source with any device driver package (ddlpars.py)
  - DDL parser application (Xinu/compile/ddl-parser.py) for configuring a particular application (obdemo) with user defined XML (Xinu/compile/pirddl.xml)
  - Device driver packages developed that are compatible with the ddlpars.py application (in dev_drivers directory)
